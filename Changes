Revision history for Perl extension Class::Null.

1.01  Sun Aug 18 13:52:05 CEST 2002
	- Class::Null is now a singleton to reduce memory overhead
	  (thanks nwetters)
	- Class::Null now creates an empty subroutine when autoloading,
	  to increase the speed of subsequent calls (they don't have to
	  go through AUTOLOAD again) (thanks nwetters)

1.00  Sat Aug 17 11:38:47 CEST 2002
	- changed 'our' to 'use vars' for $VERSION so it runs under
	  earlier versions of perl (thanks richardc)
	- fixed a POD typo
	- removed the '5.008' requirement from Makefile.PL

0.01  Fri Aug 16 17:01:00 2002
